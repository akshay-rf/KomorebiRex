## Features

-   **User-Based Filtering:**
    
    -   Fetch personalized recommendations for a specific user.
    -   Select a user from a dropdown menu or type the user's name for recommendations.
-   **Product-Based Filtering:**
    
    -   Obtain content-based recommendations for a specific product.
    -   Input the product name to view relevant recommendations based on product features.
-   **Hybrid Filtering:**
    
    -   Combine user-based and content-based filtering for hybrid recommendations.
    -   Choose a user and product to generate personalized hybrid recommendations.
-   **Interactive Feedback (Hybrid Mode):**
    
    -   Provide feedback by discarding recommended items.
    -   Discarded items won't be recommended to the selected user in future sessions.

## SVD Model
- #### SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), model based approach:
	- This algorithm takes a matrix factorization approach. The user-product rating matrix is factorized into smaller dimension user & item matrices consisting of latent factors (hidden characteristics). By default, number of latent factors is 100. These latent factors are able to capture the known user-item rating preference & in the process are able to predict an estimated rating for all user-item pair where user has not yet rated an item
- #### Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV:
	-   Post Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV,  the best parameters are found to be different for MAE & RMSE metrics
	-   'n_factors':50, 'n_epochs':10, 'lr_all':0.005 & 'reg_all': 0.2 have been chosen for building recommendations
- #### Model Metrics:
	```
	Unbiased Testing Performance

	MAE: 1.2182
	RMSE: 2.4628
	MAE: 1.2181591303900143, RMSE: 2.4628053726737846
	```
	- The MAE & RMSE metrics for testset are comparable with what was obtained using cross validation & hyperparameter tuning stages with trainset.

	- Chosen model hence, generalizes well.

<!-- Dataset Section -->

## Dataset

The [Superstore](https://uploadnow.io/f/fNQgghb) dataset contains sales data across various product categories and regions. KomorebiRex leverages this dataset to provide insightful recommendations based on user preferences and product features.
